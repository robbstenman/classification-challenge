## Description
The goal of this project was to determine which supervised machine learning model would be better at classifying spam emails. I looked at logistic regression and random forest. Prior to starting the challenge I thought logistic regression would be the better model. However, the random forest model scored higher. I believe this was because there are several different types of spam emails and each type of spam email needed to be classified as spam or not spam.


## Assistance
I did not use any assistance besides past class activity notebooks.
